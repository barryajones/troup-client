The Troup client is the frontend app that helps the user address problems that we aim to solve. The client is built on a ton of wonderful open-source projects with the goal of providing a fluid experience to the user.

**Languages:**

-   [Typescript][typescript]

**Framework:**

-   [Next][next]

**Libraries:**

-   [Apollo Client][apollo-client]

**Design system:**

-   [Styled Components][styled-components]
-   [Primer Components][primer-components]

## Available scripts

### `yarn dev`

Start the development server and watch for file changes.

### `yarn build`

Build the production-optimised bundle for deployment.

### `yarn start`

Deploy the production-optimised bundle locally to test and simulate the production environment.

### `yarn codegen`

Generate the types from the server. If you have the Apollo plugin for VS Code it should do this automatically, but this generation is an alternate way of generating the code.

### `yarn lint`

Run the linter, catching out any errors or warning that may occur.
